todo:
-> when scraping data and pulling them from api we need: 
    -> optimize add table and table row try to combine to clean up code
    -> try find a optimized way to use this as a resuable component because check episode and and calendar also have tables with the same functionality

to add:
-> filter list for interests, check episode, calendar
-> add dropdown in modal to show input requirements for each task

 
 to fix:
 -> dashboard latest images not round
 -> input change color
